## Security

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, which
includes all source code repositories managed through GitHub.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any repository, please
report it to me as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to me by sending an email to
[ale94lko@gmail.com](mailto:ale94lko@gmail.com).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can
provide) to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible
issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
